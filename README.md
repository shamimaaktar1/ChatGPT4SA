<h2 align="center">Architecting Software-intensive Systems with ChatGPT</h3>

<p align="left">
  This is the replication package for the paper: "Towards Human-Bot Collaborative Software Architecting with ChatGPT", including the data, case study,  scripts and so on (see the description below).
  <br>

  
## File Organization

1. `Case Study on Architecting the CampusBike Application.pdf` represents the detailed case study on architecting the CampusBike application. It extensively discussed the business case and specifications, functional specifications, quality attributes, constraints, and tools and technologies (infrastructure, design, implementation, and testing) for the CampusBike.

2. `Towards Human-Bot Collaborative Software Architecting with ChatGPT.pdf` 

## Demo Video 

<p>
This video explain how we can architect any software system by using ChatGpt. Especially we generated functional specifications, quality attributed, software standards, component diagrams, and class diagram. We also apply some design patterns on class diagram.

## Experiment Replication Steps

This research paper is divided into three main phases.


- [Developing the Architecture Story](#developing-the-architecture-story)
- [Enabling Collaborative Architecting](#enabling-collaborative-architecting)
  - [Architectural Analysis](#architectural-analysis)
  - [Architectural Synthesis](#architectural-synthesis)
  - [Architectural Evaluation](#architectural-evaluation)
- [Conducting the Empirical Validations](#conducting-the-empirical-validations)


## Developing the Architecture Story

<p>
This phases describes the software architecture story, which is generated based on an analysis of the software domain and depicts the operational context of the system or group of operationalized scenarios using a software solution. A prompt is used to provide the architectural story into ChatGPT as a prerequisite for collaborative architecture.
</p>


## Enabling Collaborative Architecting

<p>
The three tasks of architectural investigation, synthesis, and assessment provide the basis for collaborative architecture. 
</p>
  
### Architectural Analysis


  
### Architectural Synthesis



### Architectural Evaluation


## Conducting the Empirical Validations
