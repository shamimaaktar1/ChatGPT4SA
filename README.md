<h2 align="center">Architecting Software-intensive Systems with ChatGPT</h3>

<p align="left">
  This is the replication package for the paper: "Towards Human-Bot Collaborative Software Architecting with ChatGPT", including the data, case study,  scripts and so on (see the description below).
  <br>

  
## File Organization

1. `Case Study on Architecting the CampusBike Application.pdf` represents the detailed case study on architecting the CampusBike application. It extensively discussed the business case and specifications for the CampusBike, functional specifications, quality attributes, constraints, and tools and technologies (infrastructure, design, implementation, and testing).

2. `Towards Human-Bot Collaborative Software Architecting with ChatGPT.pdf` 

## Demo Video 

<p>
This video explain how we can architect any software system by using ChatGpt. Especially we generated functional specifications, quality attributed, software standards, component diagrams, and class diagram. We also apply some design patterns on class diagram.
